# Party Bots Gamemode Randomizer

Randomizes every setting and event (including variants) in a gamemode.  

## Install

*Requires Node.JS*  
- Clone Repo  
- Run install.bat  

And to generate a new random gamemode, run `generate.bat`  

## Creating Data Profiles

These are a folder with the following files:  
`general.mango`, `global.mango`, `platform.mango`, `player.mango`  
These files control what events exist and their lower and upper bounds.  
See `src/Data/tweaked` for an example.

To create a new profile:
- Create a new subfolder in `src/Data/`  
- Copy the event files from `src/Data/`  
- Edit the files to your liking
- Change the dataProfile in config.mango to the subfolder name
